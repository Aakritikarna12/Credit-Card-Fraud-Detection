# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to predict fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. 
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to predict fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, feature scaling, handling class imbalance with techniques like SMOTE, and exploratory data analysis to understand transaction patterns. Various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost are trained and evaluated using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The project includes visualization of results such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance to interpret model predictions. Built using Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, this project demonstrates a real-world application of ML in fraud detection and provides a scalable framework for analyzing and predicting credit card fraud.
